\section*{Overview}
This project explores usage of the IPC in the form of Unix Domain Sockets. Your
task is to create a client/server pair to process large text files to find and
transmit lines of text containing given search strings.  \\
\\
In general, your task is to create a client which uses a Unix Domain Socket to
send the name of a desired file along with a search string to the server. The
server will find all lines containing the string and return each one using the
Domain Socket. The client will format the lines and print each one,
line-by-line (each line will end in a newline char).

\newpage

\section*{Server}
The server should be started with a single command-line argument---the name of
the domain socket it will build and monitor, i.e., \\
\indent \texttt{./text-server domain\_socket\_file\_name} \\
If the server does not execute as indicated, the project will receive \textbf{0
points}. \\
\\
The server must perform as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Build a Unix Domain Socket using the provided file name in the
    argument and begin listening for client connections
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A server should host $n - 1$ clients, where $n$ is the number of
        execution contexts on the machine it is executing.\footnote{An
        execution context is a CPU core (or virtual core using techniques like
        hyper-threading).} \footnote{Note that you do not actually have to
        thread your server, only build the groundwork for future threading.}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The \href{https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/get\_nprocs\_conf.3.html}
            {\texttt{get\_nprocs\_conf}} function can be used to determine $n$.
        \end{itemize}
      \item After the \texttt{accept} function returns, the server must write \\
        \texttt{"SERVER STARTED"}  \\
        \texttt{"\textbackslash tMAX CLIENTS: 7"}  \\
        to its terminal's STDLOG (use \texttt{std::clog} and \texttt{std::endl}
        from \texttt{iostream} if using C++), where $7$ is the number of
        execution contexts - $1$.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Accept incoming connections from clients,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When a client connects, the server must write \\
        \texttt{"CLIENT CONNECTED"}  \\
        to its terminal's \texttt{STDLOG}.\footnote{Use \texttt{std::clog} and
        \texttt{std::endl} from \texttt{iostream} if using C++.}
    \end{itemize}
  \item For each client connection, a server must acquire two strings from the
    Domain Socket,
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The name and path to a file (relative to the project directory)
        \begin{itemize}
          \item When the path is determined, the server must write "PATH: "
            followed by the provided path name on a line to the terminal's
            STDLOG, e.g. \\
            \texttt{PATH: dat/dante.txt}
        \end{itemize}
      \item A search string
        \begin{itemize}
          \item When the search string is determined, the server must write
            "SEEKING: " followed by the given search string in quotes to the
            terminal's STDLOG, e.g. \\
            \texttt{SEEKING: "the journey"}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Using the path to open the indicated file 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Use Domain Socket to send "INVALID FILE" instead of file lines
        if file cannot be opened or read
      \item Close the client's connection, and
      \item Wait for next connection
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Parse the file, line-by-line, and send any line containing the provided
    search string to the client via the domain socket
  \item After parsing the file and writing all lines to the client, the server
    must print the number of bytes (characters) of text lines transmitted to
    the client:
     \begin{itemize}
       \item \texttt{BYTES SENT: 745}
     \end{itemize}
    Ensure bytes/chars are counted on the server as will be on the client. The
    \textbf{client must calculate the same value} by counting the number of
    characters it is sent from the text files.
  \item The server need not exit
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\section*{Client}
The client should start with a single command-line argument---./text-client---followed by:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The name of the Unix Domain Socket hosted by the server
  \item The name and path of the text file, relative to the root of the project
    directory which should be searched
  \item The search string for which the file will be parsed
\end{enumerate}
For example, \\
\indent\texttt{./text-client domain\_socket\_file\_name dat/dante.txt "the journey"} \\
If the client does not executed as described above, your project will receive
\textbf{0 points}. \\
\\
%
The client is used to connect to the \texttt{text-server}, pass along file, and
search string information, count the number of lines of text returned, and
print each line to STDOUT of its terminal. \\
\\
%
The client must behave as follows
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Using the domain socket file name, opens a socket to an
    already-existing server
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When a server accepts the client connection, the client must write \\
        \texttt{"SERVER CONNECTION ACCEPTED"} \\
        to the STDLOG of its terminal
    \end{itemize}
  \item Sends the text file name and path to the server
  \item Sends the search string to the server
  \item Reads all data sent from server, writing the lines of text to STDOUT,
    line-by-line
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The client must begin each line of text from the server with a
        count starting with 1 and must use a tab character (\textbackslash t)
        after the count, e.g., \\
        \\
        \texttt{1 \textbackslash t Midway upon the journey of our life.} \\
        \texttt{2 \textbackslash t Maketh the journey upon which I go.} \\
        \texttt{3 \textbackslash t From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life.‚Äù} \\
        \\
        Note that the \textbackslash t should be an actual tab character.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Writes the number of bytes received from the server to the STDLOG of
    its terminal, e.g., \\
    \indent \texttt{BYTES RECEIVED: 119} \\
    This number will depend on how much data you send from the server, e.g., do
    you send new line characters (\textbackslash n) or do you delineate in some
    other way? However you choose to calculate it, make sure you use the same
    method between your client and server. The numbers much match which
    compared.
  \item Terminates by returning $0$ to indicate a nominative exit status
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Grading}
Grading is based on the performance of both the client and server. Without both
working to some extent you will receive 0 POINTS. There are no points for
``coding effort'' when code does not compile and run. \\
\\
The portions of the project are weighted as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{makefile}: $10$\%
  \item \textbf{text-server}: $40$\%
  \item \textbf{text-client}: $40$\%
  \item \textbf{README.md}: $10$\%
\end{enumerate}
